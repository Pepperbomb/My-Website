        Hello, my name is Melissa Pfeffer and I was born in Vienna, Austria. <br>
        When I was 3years old I moved to Hamilton, New Zealand and lived there till the end of Highs School. <br>
        I am now a first year student at Massey University in Wellington studying a Bachelor of Design, <br>
        majoring in Visual Communication.<br><br>
        Throughout my high school journey I took up any opportunity to do design work. <br>
        This ranged from posters to billboards to T-shirts. <br>
        While doing this I discovered my main passion lies in advertisment.<br>
        I have designed this Website to showcase my portfolio of work, including my web design skills.
